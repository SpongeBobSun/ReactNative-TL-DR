# ReactNative - Too Long Don't Read

After using `ReactNative` in company projects for about one year, I've decide to write something about it. There are a lot of documents talking about pros and cons of `ReactNative` so l will not do that. Summarize in one word - `ReactNative` is awesome.

I'll write down the important part and bread crumbs about how `ReactNative` works in this document. Starting with `AppDelegate` of a simple project and we will go through the initialization part of `ReactNative` ,  `NativeModules` and how JavaScript code and native code connected. Along with how does `ReactNative` using `JavaScriptCore`, how does a native UI component get drew and other interesting parts.

The reason why this document is called 'Too Long Don't Read' is I will summarize contents in a chapter to a figure or a bullet list. Then I'll put it on the beginning of each chapter using title `TL;DR`.
