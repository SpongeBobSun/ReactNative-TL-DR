## TL;DR

We will talk about how native methods get called from JavaScript in this chapter. 

## Since you want to read it anyway...

If you've played with `JavaScriptCore` before \(maybe in a hybrid app\) , you might recall we can inject a native function to `JSContext` in JavaScriptCore. This could be a way for JavaScript to communicate with native code. So you might think that `ReactNative` is using the same approach to bring native calls to JavaScript.
